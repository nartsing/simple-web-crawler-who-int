# simple-web-crawler-who-int
## Project Overview
Simple-Web-Crawler-WHO-Int is a simple web scraping tool designed to extract data from the World Health Organization (WHO) Mortality Database. Specifically, it targets the "Injuries" theme available at [this link](https://platform.who.int/mortality/themes/theme-details/mdb/injuries). This tool is useful for researchers, data analysts, and public health professionals who need to gather and analyze mortality data related to injuries.

## Usage
To run the web crawler, execute the main script with the necessary parameters. The crawler will fetch and parse the data from the specified WHO Mortality Database page.

```shell
python3 spider.py
```

**Note**: This script is too simplistic and inefficient. You can use the script from https://github.com/nartsing/web-crawler-who-int instead.
